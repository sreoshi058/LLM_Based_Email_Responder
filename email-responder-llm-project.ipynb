Manually reading, classifying, and responding to each one is time-consuming. This project builds an automated email response system using a Large Language Model (LLM) that reads an incoming customer email, identifies the issue type, determines urgency and department routing, and generates an appropriate professional reply.\n\n\nRather than training a model from scratch — which would require billions of tokens and industrial-grade hardware — transfer learning was applied. A pre-trained open-source model (LLaMA-2-7B) was taken as the base and fine-tuned on a domain-specific dataset of 16,335 customer support emails. The fine-tuning technique used is LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation), which updates only a small fraction of the model's parameters, making training feasible on a single consumer GPU.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Data Preparation and Analysis**\n\nThe dataset used is a cleaned customer support email CSV containing email bodies, expected responses, issue categories, department routing, priority levels, and urgency flags. It is loaded using pandas and rows with missing body or response fields are dropped, retaining all 16,335 records.\nAn exploratory analysis is then conducted to understand the dataset's composition. Issue categories are counted and ranked — Performance/Outage (23.9%), Security Issues (21.4%), and Technical Bugs (21.1%) are the most common. Department workload is examined, with the Technical Team (34%) and IT Department (32.8%) handling the majority. A notable finding from the urgency analysis is that while 38.8% of emails are marked high priority, only 4.8% are genuinely urgent by keyword detection — indicating that priority labels alone are insufficient for urgency classification.\nEach record is then restructured into a standardised training format with three sections: [CLASSIFICATION] (containing issue type, department, priority, and urgency), [EMAIL] (the customer message), and [RESPONSE] (the expected reply). This format teaches the model classification and response generation simultaneously. Texts exceeding 2,500 characters are filtered out, though none are removed as the longest email is 1,824 characters. The dataset is then split 80/10/10 into training (13,068), validation (1,633), and test (1,634) sets and saved to the working directory.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"\"\"\"\nEMAIL DATA PREPARATION FOR KAGGLE\nPrepares email data for fine-tuning with classification\n\"\"\"\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport json\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nprint(\"=\"*80)\nprint(\"PREPARING EMAIL DATA FOR FINE-TUNING WITH CLASSIFICATION\")\nprint(\"=\"*80)\n\n# ============================================================================\n# KAGGLE-SPECIFIC: Load dataset from Kaggle input path\n# ============================================================================\nprint(\"\\n📂 Loading dataset from Kaggle...\")\n\n# IMPORTANT: Replace 'email-customer-support-dataset' with YOUR actual dataset name\n# You can see the exact path on the right side under \"Data\" → Click your dataset\nDATASET_PATH = '/kaggle/input/datasets/sabatasnimsreoshi425/cleaned-emails-csv/cleaned_emails.csv'\n\ntry:\n    df = pd.read_csv(DATASET_PATH)\n    print(f\"✓ Loaded {len(df):,} emails from Kaggle dataset\")\nexcept FileNotFoundError:\n    print(\"❌ ERROR: Dataset not found!\")\n    print(\"\\nHow to fix:\")\n    print(\"1.

The \"chat\" variant is pre-trained for instruction-following and dialogue, making it a suitable starting point for a customer support system. Since loading a 7B model in full precision would require ~28 GB of VRAM — well above the 15.64 GB available on Kaggle's Tesla T4 — 4-bit quantization is applied via BitsAndBytesConfig. This compresses the model's memory footprint by ~75% using the nf4 (Normal Float 4) format, which preserves weight distributions better than standard integer quantization. The max_seq_length is set to 256 tokens, which covers 87% of emails without truncation.\n\nLoRA Configuration\n\nInstead of updating all 6.7 billion model parameters during training, LoRA inserts small trainable adapter matrices into the model's attention layers. Only these adapters are trained while the rest of the model stays frozen. The configuration uses a rank of 16 and alpha of 32, targeting all four attention projection layers (q_proj, k_proj, v_proj, o_proj). This results in only 16.7 million trainable parameters — 0.25% of the total — making fine-tuning feasible on a single GPU.\n\nData Processing\n\nThe saved training files are loaded and processed using a smart truncation strategy that retains all 13,068 training emails. Emails within the 256-token limit are used as-is. For longer emails, the [CLASSIFICATION] and [EMAIL] sections are preserved in full and only the [RESPONSE] section is trimmed to fit — ensuring the most important input signal is always retained. All texts are then tokenized using the LLaMA-2 tokenizer with padding to a fixed length of 256 tokens.\n\nTraining\n\nThe model is trained for 1 epoch with a per-device batch size of 4 and gradient accumulation over 4 steps, giving an effective batch size of 16. A learning rate of 2e-4 with cosine scheduling is used. FP16 precision and gradient checkpointing are enabled to reduce memory usage. Training completed in 177.6 minutes over 817 steps. Validation loss tracked closely with training loss throughout (0.661 and 0.623 at checkpoints 300 and 600 respectively), indicating the model learned without overfitting.\n\nQualitative Testing\n\nThe trained model is evaluated on three test emails covering a billing query, a login access issue, and a system performance complaint. In all three cases, the model generated coherent, professional, and contextually appropriate responses — correctly addressing the issue, expressing appropriate urgency, and suggesting actionable next steps.\n\nThe model and tokenizer are saved to /kaggle/working/fine_tuned_email_responder along with a JSON file documenting the training configuration and results.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"\"\"\"\nEMAIL RESPONSE SYSTEM \n\"\"\"\n\nimport gc\nimport torch\nfrom transformers import (\n    AutoModelForCausalLM,\n    AutoTokenizer,\n    TrainingArguments,\n    Trainer,\n)\nfrom datasets import Dataset\nfrom peft import LoraConfig, get_peft_model, prepare_model_for_kbit_training\nimport time\nimport os\nimport json\nfrom transformers import BitsAndBytesConfig\n\n# ============================================================================\n# SETUP\n# ============================================================================\nprint(\"=\"*80)\nprint(\"🚀 EMAIL RESPONDER\")\nprint(\"=\"*80)\n\ngc.collect()\ntorch.cuda.empty_cache()\n\ndevice = \"cuda\" if torch.cuda.is_available() else \"cpu\"\nprint(f\"\\n💻 Device: {device}\")\nif device == \"cuda\":\n    print(f\"   GPU: {torch.cuda.get_device_name(0)}\")\n    print(f\"   Memory: {torch.cuda.get_device_properties(0).total_memory / 1e9:.2f} GB\")\n\ntorch.cuda.empty_cache()\ngc.collect()\n\n# ============================================================================\n# LOAD MODEL -
